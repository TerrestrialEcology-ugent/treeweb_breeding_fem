TREEWEB Breeding performance data foreco

This repository contains raw data on the breeding performance of Great tit and Blue tit and forest fragmentation data from the manuscript: "Forest fragmentation and tree species composition jointly shape breeding performance of two avian insectivores". The file "Treeweb_Breeding_performance_rawdata.csv" contains:
- nest_id (unique id for every nest)
- nestbox (unique id for every nestbox, 4 nestboxes per plot)
- plot (unique id for every study plot)
- tree_species_composition (tree species Qrob: Quercus robur; Fsyl: Fagus sylvatica; Qrub: Quercus rubra)
- fragment_area (surface area of the forest fragment (in hectares) in which the study plot is situated)
- edge_density (total lenght of all edges of forest with other land use classes within a radius of 300m of the plot)
- breeding_season (season when the nest was monitored (i.e 2015 or 2016))
- species (Cyanistescaeruleus: Blue Tit; Parusmajor: Great Tit)
- id_male (unique ring number of the male)
- id_female (unique ring number of the female)
- laying_date (date when the first egg was layed (YYYY-MM-DD))
- Clutch_size (total number of eggs)
- Collected_eggs (if eggs were collected for a related study)
- hatchling_number (number of hatched eggs)
- fledgling_number (number of young alive 15 days after hatching)
